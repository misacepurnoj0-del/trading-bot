# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
**Streamlit Web Application**: The main interface is built using Streamlit with a modular page-based architecture. The application features a secure login system, dashboard for market overview, trading panel for signal generation, and comprehensive settings management. The UI includes Russian language support and professional styling with custom CSS for an enhanced user experience.

**Security-First Design**: Authentication is handled through a custom SecurityManager class that implements session management, password hashing with salt, rate limiting, and IP-based access control. The system includes account lockout mechanisms after failed login attempts and secure API key storage using encryption.

**Multi-Page Navigation**: The application uses a tab-based interface with separate modules for dashboard, trading signals, portfolio management, trading history, and system settings. This modular approach allows for clean separation of concerns and easy maintenance.

## Backend Architecture
**Intelligent Trading Engine**: The core trading logic is implemented through IntelligentTrader and AdvancedTrader classes that combine multiple analysis methods. The system uses technical indicators (35%), fundamental analysis (25%), sentiment analysis (20%), and momentum analysis (20%) to generate weighted trading signals with confidence scores.

**Multi-Strategy Trading System**: Built with a strategy-based architecture that supports multiple concurrent trading strategies with different timeframes, risk levels, and signal strength requirements. Each strategy can be independently configured and monitored.

**Exchange Integration**: MEXCClient provides comprehensive integration with MEXC exchange supporting both spot and futures trading. The client includes rate limiting, connection pooling, WebSocket support for real-time data, and demo mode simulation for safe testing.

**Risk Management System**: Comprehensive risk management through portfolio diversification (maximum 3 positions), position sizing (33% capital per position), leverage control (up to 5x), and automated stop-loss/take-profit mechanisms. The system includes correlation analysis to avoid overexposure to similar assets.

## Data Processing Pipeline
**Technical Analysis Engine**: Implements a comprehensive suite of technical indicators including SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Williams %R, CCI, ATR, and Stochastic oscillators. The analysis engine processes OHLCV data to generate technical signals with proper data validation and error handling.

**News Sentiment Analysis**: Multi-source RSS feed parser that monitors 10+ cryptocurrency news sources including CoinTelegraph, CoinDesk, Decrypt, and others. Uses advanced keyword-based sentiment analysis with bullish/bearish/neutral classification to gauge market sentiment and incorporate it into trading decisions.

**Signal Generation**: Advanced signal generator that combines technical indicators, price action analysis, volume analysis, and sentiment data to create weighted trading signals. The system includes confidence thresholds and signal strength classification (strong/weak) for better decision making.

**Data Validation and Cleaning**: Robust data preprocessing pipeline that validates OHLCV data integrity, handles missing data points, converts timestamps, and ensures proper data types. Includes error handling and fallback mechanisms for unreliable data sources.
