# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
**Streamlit Web Application**: The main interface is built using Streamlit with a page-based architecture including dashboard, trading panel, analytics, and settings pages. The UI features a secure login system with hardcoded credentials (mihaail0/Mihail2019.) and includes both demo and live trading mode switches.

**Security-First Design**: Authentication is handled through a custom SecurityManager class that implements session management, password hashing, rate limiting, and IP-based access control. The system includes automatic session timeouts and login attempt tracking for security.

**Page-Based Navigation**: The application uses a modular page structure with separate modules for dashboard, trading panel, analytics, and settings, allowing for clean separation of concerns and easy maintenance.

## Backend Architecture
**Intelligent Trading Engine**: The core trading logic is implemented through an AdvancedIntelligentTrader class that combines multiple analysis methods including technical indicators, fundamental analysis, news sentiment, and momentum analysis. The system uses weighted scoring to make autonomous trading decisions.

**Multi-Exchange Support**: Built with a base exchange architecture that currently supports MEXC with extensibility for additional exchanges. The MEXCClient handles all API communications with proper authentication and rate limiting.

**AI-Powered Analysis**: The system uses multiple analysis components working together - TechnicalAnalysis for price indicators, TechnicalIndicators for advanced metrics, NewsParser for sentiment analysis, and SignalGenerator for combining all factors into trading signals.

**Risk Management System**: Comprehensive risk management through portfolio diversification (maximum 3 positions), position sizing (1/3 capital per position), leverage control (up to 5x), and automated stop-loss/take-profit mechanisms.

## Data Processing Pipeline
**Technical Analysis Engine**: Implements a full suite of technical indicators including SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Williams %R, CCI, and ATR. The analysis engine processes OHLCV data to generate trading signals with confidence scores.

**News Sentiment Analysis**: RSS feed parser that monitors multiple cryptocurrency news sources and performs keyword-based sentiment analysis to gauge market sentiment and incorporate it into trading decisions.

**Signal Generation**: Advanced signal generator that combines technical analysis (35%), fundamental analysis (25%), sentiment analysis (20%), and momentum analysis (20%) to create weighted trading signals with confidence scores.

**Data Validation**: Robust data cleaning and validation processes for OHLCV data including timestamp conversion, numeric validation, and OHLC relationship verification to ensure data integrity.

## External Dependencies
**MEXC Exchange API**: Primary integration with MEXC cryptocurrency exchange for market data, account information, and trade execution. Includes demo mode simulation for safe testing.

**RSS News Feeds**: Integration with multiple cryptocurrency news sources including CoinDesk, CryptoSlate, Cointelegraph, and others for sentiment analysis.

**Plotly Visualization**: Advanced charting and visualization capabilities using Plotly for interactive price charts, technical indicators, and trading analytics.

**Security Libraries**: Uses standard Python security libraries including hashlib for password hashing, secrets for token generation, and hmac for API signature generation.
